                <h2>Nicolò Argenta</h2>
                <p>My name is Nicolò Argenta, known as Nick. I hail from the mountainous region of Aprica, where my passion for extreme sports, particularly snowboarding and skateboarding, took root. Transitioning from the adrenaline-fueled world of sports to the realm of design, I hold a degree in Industrial Product Design and have since expanded my expertise into communication design.

                    Driven by a desire to merge my enthusiasm for adventure with a career in design, I've dedicated myself to exploring how design principles can enhance both functionality and aesthetics in various contexts. Through rigorous academic training, I've developed proficiency in conceptualization, prototyping, and user-centered design methodologies, equipping me with a solid foundation for creative problem-solving.

                <h2>Federica Milanti</h2>
                <p>I am a designer with a great passion for the audiovisual sector and editorial design. I graduated from the Polytechnic University of Milan in Communication Design in 2023 and I am now pursuing my master's degree. Working in the creative world has made me a patient and flexible person. I am aware of the importance of carefully evaluating the objectives of each project; indeed, I believe that the key lies in the ability to understand and effectively communicate the desired message. I am always open to new opportunities that allow me to grow as a designer and contribute to the world of art and visual communication. I nurture my ideas with love, dedication, and constant attention. Projects require patience, but the joy of seeing them grow and come to fruition is the most rewarding thing.

                <h2>Ludovica Cordiner</h2>
                <p>I’m Ludovica, a 23 year old girl born and raised in the Castelli Romani. My land taught me to love nature and colors, I think that part of my passion and creativity comes from there. I define myself as a down-to-earth and methodical person, but in my design journey I have also learned to indulge in creativity and imagination! (And I love it!) Being able to experiment and design methodically at the same time is what fascinates me most about design: through rules, being able to overcome them.I moved to Milan in 2020 to attend the three-year degree course in Industrial Product Design at Politecnico di Milano, where I graduated in September 2023. This path has taught me to have a well defined method, thanks to which I am able to deal with an infinite number of design contexts and in any of its strands. However, studying Product Industrial Design opened my eyes to what I am really passionate about and so I decided to bend my course towards Communication Design, a world that suits me best and where I know I’ll be able to express all of my creativity one day.I am currently attending a Master’s degree course in Communication Design in the English section also in Politecnico di Milano. I actually realised that I loved this world years ago, and today I can finally live it every day. Every branch of communication design fascinates me: from graphic design to editorial design, from brand identity to advertising design, multimedia, typography and so on. I’m looking forward to learn as much as possible!</p>
